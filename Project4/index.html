    <p>Hi there Everyone! My name is Jon Arbuckle. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am owner of a cat named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named <strong>Odie</strong>. Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat. While Odie is a dog without a brain. </p>
    <p>Although my pets drive me crazy, I can´t imagine life without them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I spend half of my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure I have bought Garfield´s favorite food, or else he´ll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sause, frozen pizzas, and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasagña. When I come home, Garfield usually atacks me a tries to eat everything. <i>I wasn´t too happy about that</i>.</p>
